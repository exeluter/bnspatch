### XML patches at run-time

bnspatch loads `%userprofile%\Documents\BnS\patches.xml`, which can be used to apply various types of
transformations to any `.xml` file loaded by Blade & Soul.

**There is also support for BnS Buddy-style addons (`.patch` files). Just place them in `%userprofile%\Documents\BnS\addons`.**

The `patches.xml` format isn't documented yet but you can read the code and figure it out,
or look at other peoples examples. It implements most of pugixml's relevant API for element and attribute nodes.

For an example of basic and advanced usage, see [`patches.xml`][1.0] at the root of the repository,
or the extra files in the [`contrib`][1.1] folder.

For more info, refer to [`xmlpatch.cpp`][1.2], [XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0][1.3], and the [pugixml manual][1.4].

## FAQ

#### Q: Does this work with [**d912pxy**][1.0]?
Yes it does!

#### Q: Isn't this unsafe compared to BnS Buddy?
Not really. I've been using some variant of it since I started development in
2017, and have never been warned nor banned, and neither has anyone else I
shared it with.

#### Q: Is this compatible with BnS Buddy?
There is some overlapping functionality, but yes. Just understand that changes made by bnspatch will
always take priority over conflicting changes made by BnS Buddy.

#### Q: Plugins and addons and patches, oh my!
Since there seems to be some confusion about the technical differences, I want to try and clear it up:

- **Plugins (\*.dll)**: These are files that make changes to the game's code in some way. bnspatch is a plugin. They are loaded by my `winmm.dll` ([pluginloader][2.1]). They belong in:
  * `%programfiles(x86)%\NCSOFT\BNS\bin\plugins`
  * `%programfiles(x86)%\NCSOFT\BNS\bin64\plugins`
  
- **Addons (\*.patch)**: Legacy BnS Buddy-style addons, what you're probably already used to. They are only capable of rudimentary searching & replacing text in .xml files. These belong in `%userprofile%\Documents\BnS\addons`

- **Patches (\*.xml)**: This is my own format, similar to addons but much more powerful, though there is a steeper learning curve. The location is configurable, but generally unless you know exactly what you're doing, you'll want to put `patches.xml` in `%userprofile%\Documents\BnS`, and any extra patches (if applicable) in `%userprofile%\Documents\BnS\patches`.
